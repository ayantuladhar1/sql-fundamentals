# SQL ALL Operator
The ALL operator is used to compare a value to every value returned by a subquery.

The ALL operator evaluates to TRUE if every value in the subquery result-set meet the condition.

The ALL operator is typically used with WHERE and HAVING statements.

## ALL Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ALL (subquery);
```

Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=)

## Demo Database
Below is a selection from the "Products" table in the Northwind sample database:

| ProductID | ProductName                  | Price |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ----- |
| 1         | Chais                        | 18.00 |
| 2         | Chang                        | 19.00 |
| 3         | Aniseed Syrup                | 10.00 |
| 4         | Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning | 22.00 |

And a selection from the "OrderDetails" table:

| OrderDetailID | ProductID | Quantity |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1             | 11        | 12       |
| 2             | 42        | 10       |
| 3             | 72        | 5        |
| 4             | 14        | 9        |

## SQL ALL Example:
The following SQL returns the ProductName is ALL the records in the "OrderDetails" table has Quantity equal to 10. This will of course return FALSE because the Quantity column has many different values (not only the value of 10):
```sql
SELECT ProductName 
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);
```

Number of Records: 0
