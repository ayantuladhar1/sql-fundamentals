# SQL Dates
The most difficult part when working with dates in databases, is to be sure that the format of the date you are trying to insert/select, matches the format of the date column in the database.

## SQL Date Data Types
Different SQL databases have various data types to store date and time values.

MySQL has the following date data types:
* DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
* DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
* TIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
* TIME - format: HH:MI:SS
* YEAR - format YYYY or YY

## SQL Working With Dates
Look at the following table:

## Orders Table

| OrderId | ProductName            | OrderDate  |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| 1       | Geitost                | 2025-11-11 |
| 2       | Camembert Pierrot      | 2025-11-09 |
| 3       | Mozzarella di Giovanni | 2025-11-11 |
| 4       | Mascarpone Fabioli     | 2025-10-29 |

Now we want to select the records with an OderDate of "2025-11-11" from the table above.

We use the following SELECT statement:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2025-11-11'
```

The result-set will look like this:

| OrderId | ProductName            | OrderDate  |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| 1       | Geitost                | 2025-11-11 |
| 3       | Mozzarella di Giovanni | 2025-11-11 |

Note: Two dates can easily be compared if there is no time componenet involved!

Now, assume that the "Orders" table looks like this (notice the added time-componenet in the "OrderDate" column):

| OrderId | ProductName            | OrderDate           |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1       | Geitost                | 2025-11-11 13:23:44 |
| 2       | Camembert Pierrot      | 2025-11-09 15:45:21 |
| 3       | Mozzarella di Giovanni | 2025-11-11 11:12:01 |
| 4       | Mascarpone Fabioli     | 2025-10-29 14:56:59 |

If we use the same SELECT statement as above:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2025-11-11'
```

we will get no result! This is becuase the query is looking only for dates with no time portion.

Tip: To keep your queries simple and easy to maintain, do not use time-components in your dates unless you have to!
