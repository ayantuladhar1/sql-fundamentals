# SQL DROP TABLE Statement
The DROP TABLE statement is used to permanently delete an existing table in a database.

Note: Be careful before dropping a table! Dropping a table deletes the entire table and all its content!

## Syntax
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

To prevent an error from occur (if the table does not exists), it is a good practice to add the IF EXISTS clause:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name;
```

Note: In most databases you cannot drop a table that is referenced by a foreign key constraint in another table. To solve this, you must remove the foreign key constraint or drop the dependent table.

## DROP TABLE Example
The following SQL statement drops the "Shippers" table:

## Example:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Shippers;
```

## SQL TRUNCATE TABLE
The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete all the records in a table, but it keeps the table structure, columns and constraints.

## Syntax
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```
